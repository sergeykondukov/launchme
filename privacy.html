        <h1>Privacy Policy for LaunchMe</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 2025</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how LaunchMe ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our macOS application (the "Service").</p>

        <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We believe in your privacy. LaunchMe is designed to be a simple, effective, and private tool.</p>
        
        <p>The application does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information, usage data, or device information. All of your application data, folder preferences, and configuration settings are stored locally on your device and are never sent to us or any third party.</p>
        
        <p>Because we do not collect any data, the concepts of data usage, sharing, and retention are not applicable to our Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>LaunchMe stores the following information locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your app arrangements and folder configurations</li>
            <li>Custom folder bookmarks (for accessing your selected folders)</li>
            <li>Appearance preferences and settings</li>
            <li>Subscription status (handled by Apple's StoreKit)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use Apple's StoreKit for subscription management. Apple handles all payment processing and subscription data according to their privacy policy. We do not have access to your payment information or Apple ID details.</p>

        <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Because the application does not collect or store any of your personal information, the rights to access, correct, or delete data are not applicable.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page. If we ever change our data practices in the future, we will update this policy and provide clear information about what has changed.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:kondukov.info@gmail.com">kondukov.info@gmail.com</a></p>
